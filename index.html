                <p id="p2text"><strong>Our product was inspired by the recent wave of backlash on our police
                departments in America, as well as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/us/police-mentos-gun-video.html" target=_blank>recent news story</a>
                about a deputy pulling a gun while off duty. We wanted to help reduce 
                tensions and make it easier to provide evidence in court. In the case where body 
                cameras or security cameras are not functioning properly or present, 
                we need a tamper-proof way to tell what exactly happened in the heat 
                of the situation. That's why we came up with the Snap-Draw holsters: 
                a cheap and easy method to keeping track of a firefight. This easy 
                and ready to produce device that can send Bluetooth signals about when a
                gun has been removed or put back in its holster. Once fully developed, 
                it could be used for tracking the number of shots fired, and when the safety is turned off. 
                Keep in mind that the device is designed for police security, we support our deputies 
                and wish them luck in their careers. This is for everyone's safety, including 
                theirs. For more information, scroll down.</strong></p>

                <p id="p3text" class="textCenter"><strong>The way our product works is whenever you pull out a gun from
                its holster, it will track the amount of times you have done so. The mechanism behind it is a small button located within the holster. 
                Everytime the gun is taken out of a holster, or put back in, the button will be pressed the action will be tracked.
                The button will then send a signal using bluetooth. The information will be sent to the police 
                department. What we aim to do, later on, is to create a way to track the amount of times the safety has been
                turned off or the amount of times a bullet has been fired.</a>

                <p id="p2text">Hello reader. Our names are Arav, Danny, Kunsh, and Nathan. Our website was designed to promote our 
                entrepreneurship project. We all currently go to Dublin High School and are taking engineering courses
                such as Computer Science and Intro to Engineering and Design. We wanted to dedicate our project to reduce
                the risk of gunfire and brutality coming from police all across America. Currently, police misconduct
                is a heated topic and people have lost lives because of it. We wish that our product could do something to 
                reduce that and save the lives of innocent people everywhere. Thank you for taking a look at our website.<br>
